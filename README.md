Xcode Version : 12.5

Design Pattern : MVP

### MVP Deign Pattern

The role of the controller is replaced with a presenter.
View is more loosely coupled to the model.
The presenter is responsible for binding the model to the view.
Interaction with the view is through an interface, making it easy to unit test.
The view creates the presenter in this particular implementation.
